## Overview

This project showcases different image processing techniques using OpenCV. It includes:
- Visualizing custom kernels.
- Applying averaging filters with different kernel sizes.
- Using Gaussian filters.
- Detecting edges using Sobel filters.

## Setup

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-filtering-opencv.git
    cd image-filtering-opencv
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

You can run the provided Python script to see the image filtering and kernel visualization in action.

1. **Prepare your image**
    - Place your image in the `images` directory and update the file path in the script if necessary.

2. **Run the script**
